Project= "Portofolio Studyclub HIMSIKA 2024 UI/UX & Frontend web developer" My project this time i use figma to create and design a prototype and than i create the prototype into website using React+Tailwindcss. The Design that i choose is just a simpele singele page website without complicated design, so its can be easy to code. This project to me 1 or 2 weeks, i enjoy making this project but using tailwindcss is just not my cup a tea. -Chytalis a.k.a Bibit
